## 974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K (medium)

First try : Time Limit Exceeded (65/73)

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraysDivByK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        arr = [0] * n
        arr[0] = nums[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            arr[i] = arr[i - 1] + nums[i]
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] % k == 0:
                count += 1
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                p = arr[j] - arr[i]
                if p % k == 0:
                    count += 1
        return count
            
```

```python
class Solution:
    def subarraysDivByK(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # frequency table to store the frequency of the remainder
        remainderFrq = defaultdict(int)
        # Empty sub array will have a sum of 0 and remainder of 0, thus the frequency of 0 is 1 before we go into the array
        remainderFrq[0] = 1
        
        res = prefixSum = 0
        for n in nums:
            # Adding n to the prefixSum, so we have the prefixSum up to the ith position.
            prefixSum += n
            # Get the remainder of the current prefixSum.
            remainder = prefixSum % k
            # We need to increase the result before update the frequency table.
            # Because we are counting how many previous prefixSum have the same remainder.
            res += remainderFrq[remainder]
            # Update the frequency table.
            remainderFrq[remainder] += 1
        return res
```
