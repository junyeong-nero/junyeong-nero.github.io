## 2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips (medium)

Brute Force Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, time: List[int], totalTrips: int) -> int:
        sorted(time)
        # print(time)
        t = 1
        while t:
            count = 0
            for p in time:
                count += t // p
            if count >= totalTrips:
                return t
            t += 1
        return -1
```

Binary Search Approach

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, time: List[int], totalTrips: int) -> int:
        right = min(time) * totalTrips + 1 
        left = 0
        answer = 0

        def check_status(expected_time: int) -> int:
            nonlocal answer
            count = 0
            for i in time:
                count += expected_time // i 
            if count < totalTrips:
                return 1 # Since number of trips are less than required, left moves to mid
            elif count >= totalTrips:
                answer = expected_time # stores the latest result. This is guaranteed to be the minimum possible answer.
                return -1 # Since number of trips are greater/equal to required, right moves to mid

        while left < right-1: # Till Binary Search can continue. 
            mid = (left + right) // 2 # mid is the current expected time.
            status = check_status(mid) # The return values 1/-1 in check_status function determines which pointer to move.
            if status == 1:
                left = mid
            else:
                right = mid
                
        return answer
```
