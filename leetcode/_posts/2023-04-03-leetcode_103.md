## 881. Boats to Save People (medium)

Two Pointer Approach, Failed at 71/76 Testcases

```python
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        n = len(people)
        count = 0
        i = 0
        j = n - 1
        print(people)
        while i <= j:
            a, b = people[i], people[j]
            print(i, j)
            if a + b > limit:
                j -= 1
                count += 1
            elif a + b == limit:
                i += 1
                j -= 1
                count += 1
            else:
                k = i + 1
                cur = a + b
                while k < n and cur + people[k] <= limit:
                    cur += people[k]
                    k += 1
                i = k
                j -= 1
                count += 1
        return count
```

But there is more clean solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        i = 0
        j = len(people) - 1
        boats = 0
        while i <= j:
            if people[i] + people[j] <= limit:
                i += 1
                j -= 1
            else:
                j -= 1
            boats += 1
        return boats
```
